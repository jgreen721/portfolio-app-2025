        I'm a Fullstack Developer based in <span className="semi-bold">Los Angeles</span>, with a strong focus on
        frontend development while maintaining a deep understanding of
        lower-level languages to enhance my intuition for high-level operations.
        I thrive on bridging the gap between functionality and aesthetics,
        ensuring that every digital experience is both seamless and visually
        compelling. My approach to development goes beyond just writing codeâ€”I
        strive to create <em className="semi-bold">intuitive, efficient</em>, and <em className="semi-bold">engaging </em> <span className="">user experiences.</span>
        {/* Whether building from scratch or refining existing systems, I ensure
        that every project is optimized for performance, usability, and design. */}
